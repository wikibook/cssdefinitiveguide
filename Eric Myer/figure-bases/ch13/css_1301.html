Meyer</a><br>Published by <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly &amp; Associates</a><br>ISBN 1-56592-622-6<br>456 pages</p><p>In many ways, the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) specification represents a unique development in the history of the World Wide Web. In its inherent ability to allow richly styled structural documents, CSS is both a step forward and a step backward&mdash;but it's a good step backward, and a needed one. To see what is meant by this, it is first necessary to understand how the Web got to the point of desperately needing something like CSS, and how CSS makes the web a better place for both page authors and web surfers.</p><p><cite>Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide</cite> does exactly that, and then goes on to describe in detail how CSS works, what its properties and values mean, and how authors can use them in the real world.  A synthesis of browser support charts, the wisdom of Web design and usability experts, and the author's unique perspective on CSS, this book tells designers how CSS is supposed to work, how browsers treat it, and what paths allow for a safe threading between theory and reality.</p><p>Written in a personal style, endeavoring to treat the reader as a peer instead of a student, <cite>Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide</cite> is the best way to crack open the world of proper style for the Web.</p></body></html>
