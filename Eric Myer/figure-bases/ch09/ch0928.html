Here was an opportunity to do things right.  Here was their big chance to finally build a city that would be functional, clean, and attractive.  Or at least not flooded with sewage every high tide.</p><p>A plan was quickly conceived and approved.  The fathers got together with the <a href="http://www.seattle.com/capitalistpigs/">merchants</a> and explained it.  "Here's what we'll do," they said, "we'll raise the ground level of the financial district well above the high-tide line.  We're going to cart all the dirt we need down from the hills, fill in the entire area, even build a real sewer system.  Once we've done that you can rebuild your businesses on dry, solid ground.  What do you think?"</p><p>"Not bad," said the businessmen, "not bad at all.  A business district that doesn't stink to high heaven would be wonderful, and we're all for it.  How long until you're done and we can rebuild?"</p><p>"We estimate it'll take about ten years," said the city fathers.</p><p>One suspects that the response of the businessmen, once translated from the common expressions of the time, would still be thoroughly unprintable here.  This plan obviously wasn't going to work; the businesses had to be rebuilt quickly if they were to have any hope of staying solvent.  Some sort of compromise solution was needed.</p></body></html>
