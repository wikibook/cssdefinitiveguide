The merchants rebuilt their businesses right away (using stone and brick this time instead of wood), as they had to do.  In the meantime, the project to raise the financial district went ahead more or less as planned, but with one modification.  Instead of filling in the whole area, the <em>streets</em> were raised to the desired level.  As the filling happened, each block of businesses would be surrounded by a retaining wall, and the streets between the walls would be filled with dirt.  This meant that the sidewalks were actually below street level, once the street was filled in, so pedestrians got to walk along a block, scale a ladder or staircase, cross the street, descend back to sidewalk level, and continue onward.</p></body></html>
